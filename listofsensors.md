       - Range: 3 to 7 meters (adjustable)
       - Power Supply: 5V to 20V
       - Output: Digital (HIGH when motion is detected)
       - Advantages: Inexpensive, low-power, and widely used in IoT applications.

### 2. **Ultrasonic Distance Sensors:**
   - **Use Case:** Ultrasonic sensors can be used to detect the proximity of visitors in real-time and monitor crowd density in certain zones by measuring distances.
   - **Suggested Model:** HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
     - **Specifications:**

       - Advantages: Low-cost, effective for visitor tracking with RFID tags or cards.

### 4. **Infrared (IR) Break Beam Sensors:**
   - **Use Case:** These sensors use an infrared beam between two components. When a visitor crosses the beam, the signal is interrupted, indicating movement, making them ideal for counting entry/exit points.
   - **Suggested Model:** E18-D80NK Adjustable Infrared Sensor
     - **Specifications:**
       - Detection Range: 3 cm to 80 cm (adjustable)
       - Power Supply: 5V DC
       - Output: Digital
       - Advantages: Reliable for entry/exit detection and low-power consumption.

### 5. **Thermal Imaging Sensors:**
   - **Use Case:** Thermal imaging sensors can detect human presence based on body heat, useful for tracking visitor movements in sensitive or dark areas of the site.
   - **Suggested Model:** AMG8833 IR Thermal Camera Sensor (8x8 Grid)
     - **Specifications:**
       - Detection Range: Up to 7 meters
       - Resolution: 8x8 thermal pixel array
       - Interface: I2C
       - Power Supply: 3.3V
       - Advantages: Detects body heat, capable of working in low light and crowded areas.

### 6. **LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) Sensors:**
   - **Use Case:** LIDAR sensors use lasers to measure distance and can be employed for precise mapping of visitor flow, especially in crowded zones.
   - **Suggested Model:** Garmin LIDAR Lite v3
     - **Specifications:**
       - Range: Up to 40 meters
       - Accuracy: ±2.5 cm
       - Power Supply: 5V
       - Interface: I2C, PWM
       - Advantages: High precision and suitable for detecting multiple objects at a distance.

### 7. **Pressure Sensors (Force-Sensitive Resistor - FSR):**
   - **Use Case:** Pressure sensors can be embedded into floors or seats to detect visitor presence and movement, ideal for tracking visitor flow without visual sensors.
   - **Suggested Model:** Interlink FSR 402 Force Sensing Resistor
     - **Specifications:**
       - Force Sensitivity Range: 0.2N to 20N
       - Response Time: Less than 1ms
       - Power Supply: Analog Input
       - Advantages: Simple, low-cost solution for detecting weight or pressure changes.

### 8. **People Counting Sensors:**
   - **Use Case:** Specialized sensors designed for counting people can provide highly accurate visitor data at entry and exit points.
   - **Suggested Model:** Omron HVC-P2 (Human Vision Component)
     - **Specifications:**
       - Detection Methods: Human body detection, face detection
       - Range: Up to 6 meters
       - Interface: UART
       - Power Supply: 5V
       - Advantages: Capable of detecting multiple human attributes including face detection and body count.

### Sensor Integration Considerations:
- **Power Supply and Connectivity:** Ensure all sensors can be powered and connected to the Raspberry Pi or Arduino using standard interfaces such as GPIO, I2C, SPI, or UART.
- **Environmental Considerations:** Depending on the heritage site’s indoor or outdoor environment, choose sensors that are durable and weather-resistant if used outdoors.
- **Data Communication:** Consider using MQTT or HTTP protocols to send data from the sensors to the server for real-time processing.

These sensors can be integrated into your system to create a robust, IoT-enabled visitor management system with real-time monitoring capabilities.
