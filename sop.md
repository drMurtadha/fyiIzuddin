### Problem Statement:

Heritage sites, often delicate and historically significant, face challenges in managing the increasing number of visitors. Overcrowding in certain areas can lead to wear and tear, environmental damage, and compromised visitor safety, particularly in sensitive or restricted zones. Current visitor management systems are typically manual or based on outdated technologies, making it difficult to monitor real-time visitor flow, predict crowd density, and implement preventive measures effectively. There is a pressing need for a technology-driven solution that can track and manage visitor movement in real-time to protect these sites while enhancing the visitor experience. An IoT-enabled visitor management system could provide heritage site managers with real-time data, analytics, and control mechanisms to prevent overcrowding and ensure sustainable preservation.
